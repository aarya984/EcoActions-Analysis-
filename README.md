# EcoActions-Analysis-
Data Analysis &amp; Visualization of Eco-Friendly Action

### Project Overview  
This project analyzes eco-friendly actions taken by individuals, exploring trends in participation, impact, and success rates. The dataset contains details about different environmental actions, their frequency, and effectiveness.  

### Features  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand patterns and trends.  
- Visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for better insights.  
- Trend Analysis of eco actions over different years and across various categories.  

### Dataset Information  
The dataset contains the following columns:  
- User ID: Unique identifier for each user.  
- Action Type: Type of eco-friendly action performed.  
- Date: When the action was taken.  
- Age: Age of the user performing the action.  
- Gender: Gender of the participant.  
- Location: City where the action was recorded.  
- Frequency: How often the action is performed.  
- Outcome: The result of the action taken.  
- Category: Type of eco-action such as recycling, energy-saving, or waste reduction.  
- Eco Impact: A score representing the impact of the action.  
- Year: Extracted from the date column for trend analysis.  

### Sample Visualizations  
The project includes visualizations such as:  
- Bar chart showing the most common eco actions.  
- Pie chart representing the distribution of actions based on gender.  
- Histogram analyzing the age distribution of participants.  
- Line graph tracking changes in eco impact over the years.  

### How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.  
2. Install the required libraries using pip.  
3. Run the main Python script to generate insights and visualizations.  

### Technologies Used  
This project is built using Python and the following libraries:  
- Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- NumPy for numerical operations.  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends and insights.  

### Conclusion and Future Scope  
This project highlights key trends in eco-actions, such as the most common actions and their overall impact. Future improvements could include expanding the dataset to cover more locations, integrating machine learning models to predict the success of eco-actions, and developing interactive dashboards for real-time data visualization.
